# Service Overview
A web application providing a matching service between job seekers and companies.

# List of Features
## Job Seeker Capabilities
* Search Function
Job seekers can efficiently search for job listings by sorting with desired criteria such as selected industry, preferred employment region, and job type (HR, accounting, technical positions).

* Favorites Function
Job seekers can add job listings they are interested in to their favorites.

* Application Function
Job seekers can apply for job listings they are interested in. Once an application is accepted by a company, job seekers can communicate with the companyâ€™s recruiter via chat. They can then arrange interview schedules through this chat. 
(However, the application does not manage interview schedules.)

## Company Recruiter Capabilities
* Job Listing Registration
Recruiters can register job listings.

* Job Listing Access Analytics
Recruiters can see who viewed their job listings, when, and how frequently.

* Search Function
Recruiters can efficiently search for potential employees based on desired industry, preferred employment region, Japanese language proficiency, skills, foreign language proficiency, years of experience, work experience, industry experience, graduation university, education history, employment history, university faculty, and whether they are from a science or liberal arts background.

* Offer Function
Recruiters can view job seekers' profiles and send interview offers to candidates they are interested in. Once a job seeker accepts an offer, recruiters can communicate with them via chat to arrange interview schedules.

* Job Seeker Management
Recruiters can manage job seekers through a management interface. They can favorite job seekers they want to make an offer to, manage information about candidates who declined offers, and track candidates who applied but were rejected. They can also record evaluations after interviews.

## Common Features
Email notifications are sent when applications, offers, or messages are received. (There are no in-app notifications.) Email notification settings can be changed by each user.

## Admin Interface
The admin interface allows for the listing and display of job listings. Searches can be performed using various criteria.

I have outlined the data structure for such an application. If there are any missing tables or columns, please suggest corrections.
